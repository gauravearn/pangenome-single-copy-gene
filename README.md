# single_copy_gene_analysis_pangenome
a single copy gene analysis pangenome which allows for the orthology already computed and allows for the alignment and phylogeny building using three alignment approaches and also allows for the GTRCAT and GTRGAMA model with 1000 bootstrap. To check the file conversion it iterates the first files at the start and see if the number matches to the number of the genes present in each files. If the number doesnt matches then it will exit.
